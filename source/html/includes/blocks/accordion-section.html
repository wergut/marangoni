                  1200 With the Miami campus initiated in 2018 and located in the Design District, studying a Bachelor’s of Fine Arts fashion degree at Istituto Marangoni Miami grants students the chance to succeed in the most in-demand fashion careers. Even in the United States, Istituto Marangoni Miami maintains its European foundation by teaching the Italian way of design and fashion but with a twist of the Miami style. IMM students are encouraged to complete their associate degree to then move on to their bachelor’s degree, and have the opportunity for acceptance into a Marangoni master’s program if desired. Once participants complete their degree, they transition into the Istituto Marangoni alumni group alongside major fashion names like Franco Moschino, Domenico Dolce, and Alessandro Sartori.
