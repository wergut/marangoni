                  1200 With the Miami campus initiated in 2018 and located in the Design District, studying a Bachelor’s of Fine Arts fashion degree at Istituto Marangoni Miami grants students the chance to succeed in the most in-demand fashion careers. Even in the United States, Istituto Marangoni Miami maintains its European foundation by teaching the Italian way of design and fashion but with a twist of the Miami style. IMM students are encouraged to complete their associate degree to then move on to their bachelor’s degree, and have the opportunity for acceptance into a Marangoni master’s program if desired. Once participants complete their degree, they transition into the Istituto Marangoni alumni group alongside major fashion names like Franco Moschino, Domenico Dolce, and Alessandro Sartori.

            <p>IMM Fashion Design students had the opportunity to participate in a contest with Salvatore Ferragamo. The brand donated 500 ties that remained unsold during the challenging times of the pandemic. Our talented students embarked on a journey of innovation, repurposing the ties to craft stunning creations, from elegant dresses to trendy bucket hats and even fashionable umbrellas. The winner of the challenge had the opportunity to have their design showcased in the Salvatore Ferragamo Bal Harbour store.</p>
